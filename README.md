# Fetch-Robotics-VR
Fetch Robotics Perception VR Project

## Introduction
This repo hosts the files used in VR running on Meta Quest 2 for teleoperating the Fetch Robot for pick-and-place tasks. The system uses JMPEG Streamer to steam camera footage of the Robot and display it in the VR simulation environment. The user can use the controller to select commands for moving the Robot to a certain location and select an object for pickup. Please check the video demo below.
